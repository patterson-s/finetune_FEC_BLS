    "# Simulating Write-in Occupations with LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to illustrate how we simulated write-in occupations to supplement our training data for the fine-tuned occupation classifier. Why do we need to do this? When the FEC collects occupation data, they only do so with a text box, not with a pre-formed menu. This means that there are often misspellings or ambiguities in how people describe their job. The BLS does provide a list of alternative spellings and names for different occupations. However, the coverage is relatively small and uneven. \n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the performance of our fine-tuned model, we decided to simulate additional instances of how people write out their occupations. After reading through the data ourselves, we designed a prompt that captures some common ways that people write-out their occupations, in the FEC dataset - for example, with misspellings, under-specifications, over-specifications, and the like. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we reframed this into the form of a dynamic prompt, where different BLS occupation groups were substituted in. The prompt is written in the form of an analogy. "
